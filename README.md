# Mom's Mahjong 🍛

A relaxing tile-matching game with an Indian Kitchen theme. Built with TypeScript and Phaser 3.

## Play

Match pairs of tiles to clear the board! Tap a free tile to move it to the hold area. When two matching tiles are in the hold area, they automatically clear and you score points.

- **Hold area**: Can hold up to 4 tiles
- **Match**: 2 identical tiles in the hold area = clear + score!
- **Game over**: Hold area full with no matches
- **Win**: Clear all tiles from the board!
